# Suggestions for Project Improvements

This document outlines suggestions for improving the SaaS template project, focusing on developer experience (DX), code quality, and long-term maintainability. These are suggestions and can be prioritized and implemented based on project needs and team consensus.

## Developer Experience (DX)

1.  **Improved Testing Strategy:**

    - **Integration Tests:** Implement integration tests to test the interaction between Next.js actions/API routes and Supabase. Tools like Playwright or Cypress could be used for end-to-end testing as well.
    - **Testing Utilities:** Create helper functions and utilities to simplify writing tests, such as mocking Supabase clients or setting up test databases.

2.  **Enhanced Local Development Setup:**

    - **Database Seeding:** Create scripts to seed the local Supabase database with realistic sample data for easier development and testing of UI components and features.

## CI/CD and Deployment

1.  **Automated End-to-End (E2E) Tests in CI:**

    - Integrate end-to-end tests (using Playwright or Cypress) into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically run E2E tests on each PR and before deployments.

2.  **Staging and Production Environment Parity:**

    - Ensure that staging and production environments are as close to identical as possible to minimize environment-specific issues. Use infrastructure-as-code (IaC) principles if feasible to manage environment configurations.

3.  **Deployment Rollback Strategy:**

    - Define a clear deployment rollback strategy in case of issues after a new deployment. Coolify might offer features to assist with rollbacks.

4.  **Continuous Integration Improvements:**
    - **Faster CI Pipelines:** Optimize CI pipelines for speed. Explore caching strategies and parallelization to reduce CI build and test times.
    - **Linters and Formatters in CI:** Ensure linters (ESLint) and formatters (Prettier) are run in the CI pipeline to automatically enforce code style.
